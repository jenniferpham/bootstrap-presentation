##[2 Bootstrap Project Exercises on Github:](https://github.com/jenniferpham/bootstrap-presentation)

For each exercise, there is a "-start.html" and a "-completed.html" file.
  -Start is a file with empty notes sections for you to fill in code.  Use "-start.html" to code and practice. You will also have to create a new .css file and put that in the css folder.
  -To see how I did it, you can look at the "-completed.html" and "-completed.css" files.
