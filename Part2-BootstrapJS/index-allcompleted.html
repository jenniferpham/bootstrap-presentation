<!-- *****ACCORDION -->

<!-- INSTRUCTIONS:
Make an accordion for frequently asked questions below:

ID: intense-workout
QUESTION: Can you get a serious/intense workout on this bike?
ANSWER: If you mean will you sweat while pedalling, the answer is Yes...either from duration or intensity (control on tension goes from 1-10) depending on how hard you want to work and for how long. That being said, my bike is set low because I'm either on the phone or on my lap-top and I'm sweating after 10-20 minutes...The best feature is just that: multi-tasking and feeling good about doing the one thing while wither working or playing on the other.

ID: comfort
QUESTION: Does this come with the backrest and extra seat cushion or must those be bought separately?
ANSWER: It does come with the backrest but not the extra seat cushion. my bottom was sore the first couple of days just getting used to it but nothing that ibuprofen couldn't take away. the seat is large and fairly comfortable. i've thought about purchasing the gel cushion cover but now whenever i ride over 20 miles in a day, i just fold up a cushy towel and that works fine. hope this helps. today is 3 weeks for me and i have ridden a total of 347 miles which is just amazing for this former couch potato. in fact, i'm riding it typing this answer. lol

ID: short
QUESTION: Would this be comfortable for someone as short as 5' 0"?
ANSWER: Yes, my wife is 5 ft and loves it!
